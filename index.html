                    <h1>Who am I?</h1>
                    <p>I am Zhasmina, a determined individual transitioning from a successful career in hospitality management to the dynamic field of software development. With a strong foundation in teamwork, effective communication, and attention to detail cultivated during my tenure in hospitality, I bring a unique blend of skills and experiences to the world of technology. <br>
                        <br>Driven by a passion for innovation and a commitment to personal and professional growth, I embarked on a journey of self-discovery and skill acquisition. Through independent study and participation in a rigorous 12 weeks software development bootcamp, I acquired proficiency in a range of front-end and back-end technologies, including HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Python, Database Design and Java. <br>
                        <br>My dedication to excellence extends beyond technical proficiency. I am known for my proactive approach to problem-solving, ability to thrive in dynamic environments, and dedication to fostering collaborative relationships. I am eager to leverage my diverse skill set and embark on a fulfilling professional journey as a Junior Software Developer, contributing to innovative projects and driving positive change in the technology landscape. <br>

                    <h1>Skills</h1>
                    <p>My coding journey began with the foundational elements of web developmentâ€”HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Python through exploration and self-learning which layed the groundwork for my transition into software development. <br><br>
                          Completing the Just IT Software Development Bootcamp was an enriching experience that provided me with a comprehensive understanding of key technologies and methodologies essential for launching a successful career in software development. The program, aligned with Level 3 qualification standards, offered practical hands-on experience in industry-standard programming languages and essential concepts, including:
                          HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Database Design, Python. <br><br>
                          In addition to these core components, I further upskilled in:
                          Database Management: MySQL and Python's SQLite, Web Frameworks: Deployment with Flask, Version Control: Git and GitHub. <br><br>
                          This immersive experience not only expanded my technical knowledge but also equipped me with practical, hands-on skills essential for real-world projects. <br><br>
                          Dedicated to continuous learning, I stay updated with the latest trends and technologies through platforms like Codecademy and industry podcasts. Additionally, I follow influential figures in the software development community on YouTube and Instagram, enriching my knowledge and staying inspired by their insights and expertise. <br><br>
                          Fun Fact: During the Consolidation week of the bootcamp, I inadvertently deleted all my project files while working with Git. It was a challenging moment that required working around the clock to recover the projects. However, I successfully overcame the setback and emerged with valuable lessons in resilience and problem-solving. ðŸ”¥
